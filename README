HOW TO CONFIGURE

1.    I use mjpg server to stream video from raspicam

   Look here to install/configure it.

   https://github.com/jacksonliam/mjpg-streamer

   *** You can always write bash scripts to launch MJPG on boot ****

 
2.    Install python cherrypy with

 
   sudo apt-get install python-cherrypy3


3.    Also you will need to add permissions to the appropriate files or just add the directory with 

   sudo chmod +x -R /home/pi/MIP/

4. launch MJPG and the python script

   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.
   ./mjpg_streamer -o "output_http.so -w ./www" -i "input_raspicam.so"


   cd /home/pi/MIP
   pyhton MIPserver.py 


About the hardware 

I am using the serial gpio port for communication to the MIP from the raspberry pi. Attached is the image "RPi-gpio-serial.jpg" for configuring the port  

Also see the WowWee github for wiring up the cable to robot 

  "https://github.com/WowWeeLabs/MiP-BLE-Protocol"

There is now a new Raspberry Pi page that might be useful aswell
